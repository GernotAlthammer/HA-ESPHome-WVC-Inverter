In this folder the ESPHome YAML codes are stored for the ESP-07S module that is replacing the original HF-LPT20 WiFi+BT module

The example code id for WVC-600W-Life, WVC-700W-Life and WVC-800W-Life micro inverters.

There is another code for an ESP8266 D1 Mini V3 with enhanced UART comunication functions. This was used for initial debugging of the internal serial interface between the HF-LPT27 module and the inverter main controller.
